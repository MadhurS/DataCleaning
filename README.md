# DataCleaning
This a sample repository made as an assignment
This repository is created as part of the assignment for week 4 of Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

First, download and unzip the data file into your R working directory.
Second, download the R source code into your R working directory.
Finally, execute R source code to generate tidy data file.


<B>Code explaination</B> <br>
The code merged the training dataset and test dataset but first the various componets of the training and test  datasets respectively. Later only required variables are extracted and read to create another dataset with the averages of each variable for each activity as per question number 5.

The code was written based on the instruction of this assignment 

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br>
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br>
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set<br>
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.<br>
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
